## PhysioConnect

## Project Overview:
PhysioConnect is a web-based appointment booking system designed for physiotherapists and patients. Both therapists and patients can sign up and log in. Therapists provide their availability and location during registration, and patients can search for physiotherapists based on location (e.g., state/city) and book appointments accordingly.
